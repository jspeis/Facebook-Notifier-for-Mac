 @brief Sends series of requests to Facebook
 
 @class MKFacebookRequestQueue
  This class is used to send a series of requests to the Facebook API.  Requests are sent incrementally and do not begin until the previous request has been completed.  This class is useful for sending multiple photo uploads or when you need to ensure you have information from one request before processing another.
 
 Optional selectors can be specified to receive information regarding the progress of the uploads in the queue.  The currentlySendingSelector will pass a NSDictionary object containing a "current" key and a "total" key indicating the current index of the request being sent out of the total number of requests.  The lastRequestResponseSelector passes the last NSXMLDocument response from Facebook.  Finally the allRequestsFinishedSelector is called when all the requests in the queue have been sent and their responses have been received.
 
 Note: All MKFacebookRequests added to the queue will have their delegate and selector set to the MKFaceBookRequestQueue and pass the responses they receive back to the MKFacebookRequestQueue which will then pass the response accordingly via the lastRequestResponseSelector.
 
 Available Delegate Methods
 
 -(void)queueRequestFailed:(id)error;<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Called when a request in the queue could not be made.  Passes the NSURLConnection error from the failed request attempt.
